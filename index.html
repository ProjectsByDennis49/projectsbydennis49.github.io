    <p>My blog is all about food. It is mainly about steak frites and bolognese which are my two favorite foods. I use Wordpress to manage my website.</p>

    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/743184976" target="_blank">Art BALL (in scratch)</a>
    <p>This is one of my earliest projects I made! I made it in scratch when I was just getting started with coding. It is a game where you use your mouse to draw with color-changing dots.</p>
