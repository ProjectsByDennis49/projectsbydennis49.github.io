    <a href="https://foodreviewswithdennis.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Food Reviews with Dennis Blog: Version 1</a>
    <p>This was my first website!</p>
    <a href="https://foodreviewswithdennis.github.io/" target="_blank">Food Reviews with Dennis Blog: Version 2</a>
    <p>My blog is all about food. It is mainly about steak frites and bolognese which are my two favorite foods. I use Wordpress to manage my website.</p>

    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/51229455/" target="_blank">Art BALL in scratch and many more</a>
    <p>This is one of my earliest projects I made! I made it in scratch when I was just getting started with coding. It is a game where you use your mouse to draw with color-changing dots. Also, click on some other games I made because it shows my learning timeline for programming.</p>
